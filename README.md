# BF2 HUD fix
## About
Simple hack that adjusts HUD to the correct aspect ratio and fixes stretching. You can see how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv0N_RxxfDI)

Credits to [BadSanta12345](github.com/BadSanta12345) who made the original fix for Alpha Project mod, but it doesn't work properly anymore.

## Download
Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/marekzajac97/BF2-HUD-fix/releases/) for a download link. Requires BF2 v1.5 patch & MS VC++ 2019 Redistributable (x86) installed on your system.

## Installation
Copy the `hudfix.asi`, `dinput8.dll` and `hud_config.txt` to the main Battlefield 2 folder. NOTE: provided config only works with vanilla BF2 HUD, any HUD modifications will not work!
